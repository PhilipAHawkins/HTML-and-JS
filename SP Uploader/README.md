Work in Progress 

Attempts to make an app that can reside on a SharePoint site
The user can visit the webpage and upload an Excel spreadsheet to a SP list.

This functionality is currently hackified by many SP users who've struggled to
have a system allowing them to quickly upload data to an SP list with any
number of restrictions on it regarding users and accesses and whoever has the
Access database privileges and SQL Server backend and so forth.

Select a file, select a SP list to send to, and this app does the rest.
The site and dependencies can exist as an SP Site Page that any user can access,
negating the need to worry about who can access the list in the first place or
if they have a Targeted Group page or literally anything else that SP throws
at users to make their life miserable.

If they can access the page, they can send their data. Simple.

TODO:

Pretty much everything, including making TODOs. Likely dependencies needed are
included in the folder.
